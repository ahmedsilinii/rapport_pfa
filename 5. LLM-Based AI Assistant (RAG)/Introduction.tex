This chapter explores the development of an intelligent assistant designed to support users with questions related to respiratory health. By combining language understanding with access to trusted medical information, the assistant aims to deliver clear, helpful, and relevant responses in real time. Our focus is on creating a system that is not only powerful but also accessible and responsible.

In the following sections, we walk through the key stages of building this assistantâ€”from understanding the problem and preparing the data, to designing the system, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for real-world use.
