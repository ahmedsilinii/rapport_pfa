This chapter outlined the development of our AI assistant powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. From concept to deployment, the focus was on creating a helpful, reliable, and multilingual tool to assist users with respiratory health questions. The results demonstrate the potential of combining retrieval with generation to provide informative and grounded answers, while always emphasizing the importance of professional medical advice.
